Preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks gestation) is associated with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Risk factors include previous preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, cervical insufficiency, uterine abnormalities, infections, smoking, and low socioeconomic status. Prevention strategies include progesterone supplementation, cervical cerclage, and addressing modifiable risk factors. Threatened preterm labor may be managed with tocolytics, corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation, and magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection.
