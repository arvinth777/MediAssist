Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) refers to glucose intolerance first diagnosed during pregnancy. Risk factors include obesity, advanced maternal age, previous GDM, and family history of diabetes. Screening occurs at 24-28 weeks with oral glucose tolerance test. Uncontrolled GDM increases risk of macrosomia, birth trauma, neonatal hypoglycemia, and cesarean delivery. Long-term maternal risks include type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Management includes dietary modification, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin if needed.
