Common fetal ultrasound biometry includes biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), and femur length (FL). These measurements estimate fetal weight and detect growth abnormalities. The nuchal translucency scan at 11-14 weeks screens for chromosomal anomalies. The anatomical survey at 18-22 weeks examines fetal structures for congenital abnormalities. Third trimester scans assess growth velocity and amniotic fluid volume.
