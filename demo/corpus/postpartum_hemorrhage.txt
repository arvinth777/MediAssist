Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is defined as blood loss exceeding 500mL after vaginal delivery or 1000mL after cesarean. The most common cause is uterine atony, followed by trauma, retained placenta, and coagulopathy. Risk factors include prolonged labor, multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios, previous PPH, and placenta previa. Prevention includes active management of third stage with oxytocin. Treatment involves uterine massage, uterotonics, fluid resuscitation, and possibly surgical intervention.
