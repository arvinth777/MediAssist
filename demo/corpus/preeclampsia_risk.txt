Preeclampsia is a multi-system hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. Risk factors include nulliparity, advanced maternal age, obesity, chronic hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, multiple pregnancy, and previous preeclampsia. Maternal complications include stroke, liver rupture, renal failure, and HELLP syndrome. Fetal complications include growth restriction, placental abruption, and preterm birth. Low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks may reduce risk in high-risk women.
