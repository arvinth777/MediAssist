Anemia in pregnancy is commonly due to iron deficiency. Risk factors include poor dietary intake, multiple gestations, and short interpregnancy intervals. Symptoms may include fatigue, pallor, and reduced exercise tolerance. Screening is performed with complete blood count in early pregnancy and again at 24-28 weeks. Treatment typically involves oral iron supplementation, with intravenous iron reserved for severe cases or intolerance. Untreated anemia increases risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal morbidity.
