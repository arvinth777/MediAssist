Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia. Chronic hypertension exists before 20 weeks gestation. Gestational hypertension develops after 20 weeks without proteinuria. Preeclampsia involves new-onset hypertension with proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction. Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizures in preeclampsia. Risk factors include nulliparity, multiple pregnancy, previous preeclampsia, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune conditions. Management depends on severity and gestational age.
