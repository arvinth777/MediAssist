Maternal infections relevant to pregnancy include urinary tract infections (UTIs), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), group B streptococcus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella, and varicella. UTIs increase risk of preterm birth and require antibiotic treatment. STIs like syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B are screened in early pregnancy. Group B streptococcus screening occurs at 35-37 weeks, with intrapartum antibiotics given if positive. TORCH infections can cause congenital abnormalities. Vaccination against rubella and varicella is recommended before pregnancy.
