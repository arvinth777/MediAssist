Fetal growth restriction (FGR) reflects a fetus not achieving its genetic growth potential. Causes include placental insufficiency, maternal hypertension, smoking, and fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnosis relies on ultrasound biometry showing estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile. Serial growth scans and Doppler studies guide management. Severe FGR may require early delivery. Complications include stillbirth, neonatal hypoglycemia, and long-term developmental issues.
